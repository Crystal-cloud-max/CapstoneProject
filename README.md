# CapstoneProject
I created a master component as the home page
I created register and login components to authorize the user to create new account and login
I created 2 components for products one for CRUD and the other just to show the details on a separate page.
I created 2 componenets for the supplier one for CRUD and the other to geta a supplier by id
I created 1 component for order management it gave me experience to add a one-to-many and many-to one relatioship for the order request containing a hashmap from the backend so I did research on the weekend to integrate it to the front end. When I add an order I have to refresh the page to show added order after clicking the place order button
I created inventory tracking component to display the low stock alerts under quantity of 3 per the requirement specs
